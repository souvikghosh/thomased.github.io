### Colour polymorphic lures

The maintenance of adaptive genetic variation is a classic problem in evolutionary biology. Colour polymorphisms – multiple, discrete coloured forms within a species – offer a simple visual tool with which to explore the evolutionary processes that maintain variation. My PhD research is focused on the potential for ‘sensory drive’ to generate and maintain polymorphism in a poorly understood class of visual signal: prey lures. Drawing on spiders that use conspicuous colours to attract prey, such as the exuberant _Gasteracantha_ spp., I am working to better understand the evolution of this striking feature of the natural world.

### Iridescence

The stunning colour patterns showcased by butterflies results from the mixing of thousands of individually coloured scales that cover the wing. Selection in this group has generated an array of optical structures – such as multilayer reflectors, diffraction gratings, and 3-D gyroid crystals – as well as intricate display behaviours. This makes butterflies an ideal system for investigating the evolution of iridescent signalling systems, and my research addresses both proximate and ultimate questions.
