### Resources

If you're interested in sensory ecology and the study of colour, there is a [directory](http://colsci.weebly.com/contact.html) of labs and people that work in the field, along with a public [google+](https://plus.google.com/communities/104374731636651934177) group that occasionally meets to chat about papers. There's a very active community on twitter, including a bot for the latest [papers](https://twitter.com/colsci_papers), and a [hashtag](https://twitter.com/#colsci).
