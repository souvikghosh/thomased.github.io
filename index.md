### About me

I'm Tom White. I study behavioural and visual ecology, with a focus on the evolution of colour pattern and visual system diversity. I mostly use invertebrates, both in recognition of the enormous chunk of biological diversity they represent, and for the intriguing opportunities afforded by non-model organisms. 

I'm currently a PhD candidate in the labs of [Darrell Kemp](http://www.evolutionaryecologymq.com/) and [Marie Herberstein](https://sites.google.com/site/behaviouralecologymacquarie/) at Macquarie University. Feel free to get in touch via email (thomas.white[at]mq.edu.au) or the contact details at the bottom of each page!
