### About me

I am a PhD candidate in the labs of [Darrell Kemp](http://www.evolutionaryecologymq.com/) and [Marie Herberstein](https://sites.google.com/site/behaviouralecologymacquarie/) at Macquarie University. I am interested in addressing evolutionary questions through the study of visual and behavioural ecology.

My current research is focused on the evolution of visual signalling systems. I mainly use invertebrates, both in recognition of the enormous portion of biological diversity they represent, and for the intriguing opportunities afforded by non-model organisms.

My contact details are at the bottom of each page, feel free to get in touch!
