### About me

I'm Tom White. I study visual and behavioural ecology, with a focus on the evolution of colour pattern and visual system diversity. I mostly use invertebrates, both in recognition of the enormous chunk of biological diversity they represent, and for the intriguing opportunities afforded by non-model organisms. 

I'm currently a PhD candidate in the labs of [Darrell Kemp](http://www.evolutionaryecologymq.com/) and [Marie Herberstein](https://sites.google.com/site/behaviouralecologymacquarie/) at Macquarie University. My contact details are at the bottom of each page, feel free to get in touch!
